    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Copilot</li>

# Testing

<p> The website has been extensively manually tested to ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All menu items on the Navigation Bar work as intended.</li>
    <li>All menu items on the burger menu on the mobile version of the website work as intended.</li>
    <li>All links work as intended and open in a new browser window.</li>
    <li>All form validation works as intended.</li>
    <li>The form can be successfully submitted and the success page is displayed.</li>
    <li>The website is fully responsive on all devices, from mobile phones (<576px>) to extra extra large screens (>=1400px).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bugs/Issues found</h2>
<p>The following bugs were found during testing at various stages of the project, and were all fixed using a combination of manual fixes and help from Copilot:</p>

<ul>
    <li>When clicking the menu items in the burger menu on the mobile view, the section headings were not appearing directly below the nav bar. This was fixed with help from Copilot.</li>
    <li>The cards in the Wellness Tips section were not formatting correctly for medium screens. This was manually fixed.</li>
    <li>Some images were not appearing correctly on the live site - this was because some of the filenames had an initial capital letter which was not reflected in the code. This was manually fixed.</li>
    <li>The footer was not sticking to the bottom of the Success page. This was fixed with help from Copilot.</li>
    <li>Initially I was not satisfied with the images that Copilot generated as they all looked the same. Eventually, after several refinements, I am happy with them.</li>
 </ul>

<p> In addition, I needed help from one of the Coding Coaches (Roman) as I was having trouble git pushing the site. This was because I had edited the Readme document directly in Github rather than in VSCode.</p>

<h2>Code Validation</h2>

<h3>HTML</h3>

A few bugs were found in the intial check using [WC3 validator](https://validator.w3.org/), with a couple of missing closing tags and some closing p elements in the wrong place. These were manually fixed and no further errors were found.

<h3>CSS</h3>
